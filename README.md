# Python-Email-Sender
Python Email Sender (PES) is a program made with Python using smtplib, socket and tkinter. This program was made for sender email to be a gmail account because that's what I used when testing it out, to make it work for a gmail account turn off secure app and then put in your email and password into the right variables and the program should be good to run!
