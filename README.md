# Python-Email-Sender
Python Email Sender is a simple email sending that uses stmplib, socket for the email part and tkinter for the gui, it only works with gmail and can only send a subject and body text. If you would like to expand upon this feel free to fork it.

# Archive
As of the 26th of August 2022, I have to achrive this repo because on the 30th of May 2022 google has disabled the option of allowing 3rd party apps to send emails. I have only learnt about this recently and have had to archive this.
